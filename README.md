# 📖 URI Judge exercises!
> URI online judge: resolution of the exercises

## 👋🏻 Welcome guys!
Here's where I'm going to put some resolutions of the [URIJudge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br) exercises! <br>
**Feel free** to *colaborate!*

## 👀 Project structure
The project structure's so simple. The files are separated by "*Difficulty Level*" and inside it you'll find the programming languages I used, just pick one and select your exercise by its "*ID*". 😉
